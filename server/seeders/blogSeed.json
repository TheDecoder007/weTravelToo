These reasons can be all across the board, from simply a way to make money to fund their travels, to a creative outlet, to a platform to share with a variety of friends and family what they’re up to. There would be little point to me writing content if I didn’t think you could go elsewhere to find it. Not only do I not want to have to compete for a number one spot in Google, but I also just don’t care what anyone else is doing.",

She documented the experience for those who knew her so that they could also have a taste of her travels virtually. The exciting part of Jodi’s experience is that she developed the blog to also share about food. She believes that food has a way of bringing you closer to the people of a place as well as their culture. It also reduces the chances of sickness during travel because you are aware of what exactly you’re taking in. She is passionate about finding the right food for people with celiac so you can get gluten-free restaurant cards on her blog. A celiac, Jodi has also developed a long list of gluten-free guides based on her travels, to help other celiacs travel safely around the world. Also, she offers travel tips and resources.Her travel blog has been featured on so many renowned platforms- the New York Times, National Geographic, The Guardian, Fast Company, BBC Travel, CNN, and more. Legal Nomads has also bagged several awards: multiple Lowell Thomas Awards and North American Travel Journalism awards for writing and photography.",

People crowd the busy streets lining up for tacos from a local stand, kids roam the squares causing mischief and playing blissfully without the need of a device or smartphone, and women sell their crafts with two kids in toe. Yet despite the colour and chaos of Mexico is runs at a very slow pace, operating on no particular timetable with no apparent need to fit the 9 to 5 schedule. They’re political and artistic, debating the state of their country – yet remaining fiercely proud – while listening to local buskers working the crowds like musical aficionados. Two things I will forever associate with Mexico. Squeezed on tacos, wedged into beers, delicately placed on cocktails. Lime is so prevalent it amazes me there’s no consensus on what to call it in Spanish. No problem calling for chilli though, in Mexico, everything calls for chilli.",
